<p>Greece is still a little bit behind when it comes to offering options for vegans or vegetarians but thankfully, this restaurant saves the day a little. One could argue that they wouldn’t even be able to visually tell the difference between what they are eating and actual meat and the taste is not substituted either. This restaurant offers, fabulous vegetarian and vegan options at an affordable price and they have a large variety of dishes they offer. This makes it a little gem in the restaurant industry, especially for a category in which choices of restaurants are scarce. Vegetarian or not, this place is worth it.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/veganbeatgr/"> <b>Learn More</b></a>

  Amazing vegan food with incredibly friendly staff,good prices and a nice range of salad with the meal. Instead of cups they did spiralized deep fried potato, which was really refreshing as it wasn't as heavy as chips. I also had a turmeric, ginger lemonade which was fantastic flavour wise. Overall great place to be. Seating limited, but worth going for :-)

  Great quality food and the owners are very friendly! One of the only places in Athens where you can escape the meat craze and it's definitely worth it! My group and I got gyros, lahmajoun, and the potato skewer side (amazing). The spices they add even remind you of real meat while still staying on the healthy side. Definitely coming back here for round 2!

<p> Very cute and unique restaurant. This restaurant is a whole mood by its self. It is very laid back and comfortable. Its interior space offers a coffee shop feeling and even has an area with private rooms and the option for certain tables to sit down. This is a unique design for Greek standards as its not typical for customers to be eating while sitting on the floor. Somehow though, the atmosphere they create is very welcoming and enjoyable. At the same time, when you see the food the only thing that will come to your mind is WOW. The portions are really big but that only means that you get double as much tastiness!! Definitely recommend this place.

  The forest burger is so good! Big portions! Went three times in three days. Dahl soup tasty; suggest you squeeze the whole lemon wedge into it. The quinoa salad with avocado and coriander and walnuts is divine and the raw chocolate tarte is superbe worth every penny!

  have eaten here before, and wanted to try their new dishes. This time I went to this restaurant with my parents, and they were amazed the delicious food. The management at Avocado take special care their vegetarian/vegan clientele by offering a variety of appetizers, salads and entrées that are healthy and strictly vegetarian.
